> Team left in TEARS as hopes dashed in 24 Hours of Le Mans race 🇫🇷
the D and the double yellow oh my goodness the 27 car again Indianapolis so a similar accident potentially that is the heart of racing team Daniel Manelli in the car that has had a roll over and as you say this is going to cause yeah safety car oh my goodness oh he's getting out that's such a good view aming because when you look at the damage are you okay okay I'm okay okay stay in the car wait for the marshals to get to you yeah Indianapolis same point to get okay now we can talk about it a little bit more freely the main thing we've always got to make sure is that the driver is okay great call by Edwardo for our test the uh the the um director here to get the safety car out immediately uh in that situation so everyone obviously shaking hands that first of all their driver is okay they've done an amazing job super unfortunate let's see the replay hopefully soon now we know he is all right but again Indianapolis under the trees loaded rear left going into that super super off camber right-hander before breaking into the left it's a risky risky part of the track Porsche curves is a very very quick section but at least is dry here we've got the replay was there contact I don't think there was I think he just got wide on the water and it snapped the exact same way that nazza snapped but into the tie barriers W so it looks dramatic and it is dramatic but the barrier has done its job so the car looks worse and it's upside down granted but there's a crumple Zone carbon fiber into tires and it's dissipated that energy so we've got another view yeah this was on board with that car this is that's how it went this is the Aston Martin Vantage that's what if you're wondering what that what is that car that's upside down it's an Aston Martin Vantage the heart of racing team that have been going really really well Daniel Manelli the 35-year-old Italian but he is thankfully out of the car safely and as you say going in backwards as well into a tire barrier like that so as a driver when you go in backwards it's it feel it's not as dangerous because you've got full support from the back of the car in a way um you haven't got an engine that's trying to pile into you um so although that was a big big hit I think he'll he as we saw he got out okay he will so there's a few things there first of all the tire barrier is in the right place it's there to make sure that when the car does go off Indianapolis it doesn't slide into the apex of the left-hander and into the side of the 50 Ferrari you know a solid carbon fiber monoco would have hurt both cars potentially into the driver's side on top of that you're going backwards in you're rested against a ricaro seat full six-way harness hands device attached onto your helmet full belts you know these are incredibly safe cars and we've just seen a crash at over 100 mph backwards into a wall into a sudden stop and he's walked out and the only thing he's annoyed about is that he's disappointed that he's not going to be able to stand on that Podium at lemon to him that's probably uh more painful emotionally than it than it will be physically gutted for that team they were doing incredibly well they were absolutely an absolutely fantastic job they've had some good results they're third in the championship coming into this race at Lon they had a second place finish in in Qatar and uh well yeah a tough one Ian James who is the team principal but also driver for the number 27 car he would have been watching that seeing having been in the car a lot himself uh that must have been a very scary moment to see that but the great news is that Daniel's been able to get out it's a great shame they were definitely on for a great result a Podium definitely maybe even more if things had changed further on but that's the way it goes and you know we've still got 6 hours 20 minutes to go in the lam more 24hour race things can happen right down to the end um and this of course is all going to Bunch everybody up so we're under safety car now we're back into the safety Car Zone of three safety cars just taking the cars around and now hopefully we're going to get the car turned over so yeah we're going to get the car turned over here now don't leave us here because we have some incredible racing coming up because this is not going to be the same safety car period you saw before the difference here between a tire barrier versus a uh concrete barrier or safer barrier is as we see the emotion there between just you got to feel for the team I mean heart of racing and the emotion down there at the moment is just intense and you can totally understand it they've done such a fantastic job and now here we are on Sunday morning and it's all gone completely wrong but thankfully they're okay okay got a damaged car but the drivers are okay but it's just incredibly emotional moment right now for this team yeah this isn't just a few hours of upset this isn't a week of lemon upset this isn't a year of wack upset people spend their lives trying to get to this race and their lives to try and stay in this race so those tiers are not just tiers from we see the damage now from from the 27 um so we've got another replay here this is actually from the CCTV so it doesn't look like there's contact but yeah a big snap very sa oh glad the Marshals are okay as well glad the Marshals are okay there yeah and as you said you could see there there definitely wasn't contact that was his eror he was trying to keep out of the way but of course he was on the wet bit you're on the Wet Side he's out wide here you can see the dry a bit on the right from that view he's on the slightly wet and it's just so easy to make that mistake it's tough and and I'm sure he was going 20 30k slower than he was when he was online probably thinking that'll do but you've never ventured onto that part of the track with that water at that time all the team absolutely gutted yeah watching those replays as well I tell you what is impressive in any race car nowadays though when you see it turned back up and the lack of damage on the roof and the wind screen no damage at all even though it's Hit the Floor pretty hard upside down there's there's no damage around the top it's all around the back where where it went in backwards here you go the spin goes in backwards BOS and then the driver just holding on but you can see from that there's yeah and you hear that sound from the driver as well and the reaction from other teams too yeah nobody likes to see that in Motorsport but what we do like to see of course is the driver getting out safely and there is the damage around the back and the side but the roof very solid I'm glad to see that he was able to get out and there was no issue no fire nothing like that because I think the reason it took him more while to get out was kicking that door open which is now removed

fair way behind here in third place but Robert Lambert off that inside gate terrific SM working hard on the outside R the outside of freck Here We Go Again from the world champion yeah it's a long way around there but he's generating a lot of speed he's now got himself level with Max frck I think he's got a chance of hitting the front frck a little bit quicker around the inside on that turn see his noses there he's had a look across his right shoulder and SM sticking with it look how close the defense he is oh oh there's no room there Cy that was tight down the back straight fair play to frck Frick could have made that really really awkward for smck he did try but smli through in the second place but for how long Here Comes Frick again oh it's tight as they go through the final corner but for Robert Lambert he finishes his qualifiers off in style going good again tonight here we go oh they're away on the inside frecks there brilliant start from Max frck Jack holder follows him through ml Mickelson makes it very hard for Dan Buy in the first corner and bu's got a lot of work to do if he's going to get back in the final here in mea but Max freck what a KN is enjoying and Jack holder the OES are looking strong yeah they're looking strong looks like they've got this swn up nichelson really is winding on around the side I just feel that that dirt Line is now too far and Jack hard took gate two it's always a fear when gate one statistically is the best and you hand it to Max frck but this will do for him two Aussies look like they're heading for the final M Michelson in third place he's keeping Dan buia Bay there but Max fck sharp away from the tapes what a return to Grand Prix Speedway for the Aussie Ryder he going to win at a caner here and he's through to the final Max
