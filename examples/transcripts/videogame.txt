> Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree - WHAT&#39;S CHANGING?
[Music] when you think about a paid expansion to a game you enjoy several things come to mind how the core gameplay has evolved the various additions and quality of life improvements that make for a better experience and how the new story UPS the stakes however when considering expansions to from software titles the common statement seems to be it's more of X and I love it the old Hunters is more of bloodborne and it's great the ringed city is more of Dark Souls 3 and it's fantastic Etc not that this is a bad thing yet it's interesting how despite so many changes and new additions the experience of a new from soft expansion boils to making you feel like you're experiencing the base game for the first time that sense of wonder returns Everything feels exciting again when it's not overwhelmingly difficult and makes you despair I melanous Scarlet rot his wits are long gone the same applies to Elden ring shadow of the her tree the first and probably last for the foreseeable future paid expansion to the open open world action RPG it features a new region the land of Shadow with a mysterious history shrouded until now Queen maica set foot here first before the lands between and surprise became an imperion that would establish a dominant Empire what went down what is the violent Purge that took place who exactly is Mesmer the Impaler for that matter what does it have to do with mcka melania's brother who ventured to the land of Shadow for some unknown purpose whatever the case it's your job to pursue right off the bat the quest feels much more personal and not just for you also pursuing mcka is this group of Warriors Lita welcomes you to the entrance conveniently located at the Cocoon of mwin Palace where MOG Lord of blood was fought and is required to be to access the DLC [Applause] while exploring the region you encounter other characters like Freya formerly allied with Roden the horns Cent and they'll provide updates on mela's progress through the region at certain points not quite understanding what he's after but knowing their role all the same based on previews and Impressions the land of Shadow despite being roughly larger than limb grave is absolutely massive that was intentional per director he taka Miyazaki to PC Gamer because quote we wanted an experience for the player that was going to match that of the base game we wanted them to experience that sense of Discovery and that sense of wonder and exploration again we needed a map that was going to uphold that and bolster that end quote density is just as important especially the ratio of Legacy dungeons to open field areas and how they intertwine when asked by the publication if it's pursuing a more Dark Souls style of world design M as Zaki said quote there was a sense of that as we were building it I think what you're describing there is what we tried to achieve this time with something that's not quite an open field and not quite a legacy dungeon it's something that kind of Blends the two and creates that better sense of verticality end quote while you're going to have those large fields to explore providing that Grandeur and sense of wonder there will be more variety as well so we hope what you were experiencing was that attempt to add to the variety of how we space out and structure the open field to the Legacy dungeons he noted we've already heard about some of the dungeons like bellot and its eclectic mix of scorpions and Grave Birds both new enemy types alongside the traditional armored threats or caria incest with its magic based caran foes including Giants who unleash powerful spells based on impressions of both they're not quite Legacy dungeons but also not exactly on the scale of something like say castle mour it's an interesting middle ground and the fact that they're more tightly packed with less downtime time in between should make for an altogether different experience from the base game of course the fundamental Elden ring experience is changing in other ways there's about 100 new weapons and from software is letting its imagination run wild a blade that splits into two swords you can dual wield with a weapon art that's essentially a dashing side stab a lighter great swword in the form of Melody which also activates a stance to transition into different follow-ups the dry Leaf Arts which are more akin to martial arts than probably anything from software has offered to date they're much less like weapons and more like brand new play styles to explore and build on which is exciting other exciting prospects are the scatter tree fragments and revered Spirit ashes the former reduces the damage received from enemies while the ladder increases the damage dealt by your spirit summons you could look at them as no different from the temporary Buffs available throughout the game whether it's through consumables or incantations but they're always and only active in the land of Shadow so unlike the base game you have an Avenue to make the experience somewhat easier on yourself though enduring the various horrors of the new region to find them necessary then again you cannot use them and keep the same level of challenge throughout while there could be some concern over whether from soft is balancing around these fragments I'd like to think it's giving that extra degree of freedom to players who want a more challenging experience think of all the powerful builds that already exist and what shadow of the UR tree is going to make possible with its new weapons sorceries and incantations having a difficulty that goes further beyond the norm is almost a gift finally a way to truly test oneself Beyond installing mods there's also the possibility that the expansions launch will offer a patch that rebalances and adjusts the entire game some excellent weapons could get knocked down to the still very good tier While others could make it to shadow of their former self there's no telling how many builds could be made worse or even better for that matter of course there's another part of the appeal that feeling of a clean slate and building up towards something brand new struggling against all of the entities of this new world while making a name for yourself of dying numerous times but learning a bit more on each go around till you finally claim victory whether you looking ated from the perspective of build crafting a different flavor of open world exploration or a new kind of story that's less one ring to rule them all and more what is even going on Elden ring shadow of the her tree is a game Cher for longtime fans yes it's innately familiar but it expands on what players already love about the original while potentially giving them something they didn't even know they wanted if it ends up standing out much like the base game did it could become from software's best expansion to date and another shining example of what works on top of other quality content with the expansion launching on June 21st for Xbox series PS5 and PC it's thankfully not that long before we find out firsthand and with that we reached the end of the video have anything to say let us know in

> The Best Power Banks for Traveling - Budget to Best
hey let's face it everyone we all need power we all need to recharge especially after a long day of work we need to get our energy levels back up that's just the human condition but it's not just us that needs charging so do our everyday items like our laptops and our smartphones but you know as people who are constantly on the go we might not have time to sit around and make sure our 10% iPhone is up to Snuff for what we need and can get us through the rest of the day that's why power Banks were invented these portable charges are perfect for anyone going on a long trip maybe to a theme park or just a long flight where the presence of an electrical outlet is scarce and that's why we've done the testing drained several iPads in order to compile a list of the best power banks for those digital Nomads Among Us now if you're out and about touching grass while still keeping your Tech tucked tight well these are some of the very best power Banks you'll want to consider while on your trip I'm AE and this is budget to [Music] best if you're looking for the best option for your budget the anchor 523 power core slim is one you should definitely take a look at now this one's a 10,000 MH battery which is enough to fully charge an iPhone 15 three times over that Anchor Great and the company's known for some of the very best portable chargers out there and in fact we have about six on our official list of best power Banks now the thing about this one however is that it's $26 giving you a significant bang for your buck now you get a 20 W charging speed with a USBC connection which will charge up your smartphone or tablet really really fast and there's another USB port that comes in at 12 WS allowing you to simultaneously charge another device and you can easily check when your anchor 523 is running low one power by simply pressing the LED button on the chassis it's pretty simple and given the overall design you definitely shouldn't have a problem packing it into your backpack or your fanny pack yes I I use a fanny pack myself please don't judge and while the anchor 523 power core slim is a great budget power bank let's say you you have a bit more cash to spend and multiple devices needing to be topped off well that's where the Mofi Power Station comes into play at just $13 more than our previous recommendation the Mofi Power Station gives you a speedy charge through its 20 W USBC port with two usba a ports providing 18 Watts a piece or a combined 15 watt speed if you're charging multiple things at once it's much like our anchor it's a 10,000 mAh battery with this one the type-c port you can get your phone charged to about 50% in a little under 30 minutes now that's if your phone was completely at 0% so you'll definitely be fully charged in no time the power bank has integrated LEDs to let you know when it might need to recharge itself now this one's super lightweight as well so portability is definitely possible and it's Quick Charge will make it so that your time tethered while on the go is short and sweet and my personal favorite is the anchor 737 power core 24K now it's actually the best portable laptop charger on our list now just in case you can find an outlet at your local coffee shop the anchor 737 power core 24K is your best option it's a little pricey though coming in at $109 but with 24,000 Mah and a Max output of 140 WTS well it's well worth considering in order to keep your MacBook or Ultrabook topped off while they're running you can also feed power through two additional devices one that gives you 18 Watts through a usba a port and another at 122 WTS in the provided USBC Port now all this while still plugged into your laptop mind you and you can charge the actual power bank in under an hour that's pretty impressive given the amount of juice this thing holds now if overheating is a concern of yours which it definitely should be fortunately there's included Tech that monitors the temperature to ensure you're safe from an unexpected burnout not to mention the intricate digital display that will keep you informed on the total input and output power estimated time to recharge items and and the overall battery health now I got to tell you right now it's a bit on the chunky side of things but worth every single pound and Penny if you've got higher in Tech you'd like to keep charged now I've flown on planes where you know I needed to work on projects on my laptop and and not every plane has an appropriate outlet for me to stay fully charged while I'm tooling away on Pro Tools or Premiere Pro but with the anchor 737 power cord 24K it really has come in handy and clutch on numerous occasions so there you have it the anchor 523 power core slim the Mofi power station and the anchor 737 power core 24K now those are just some of our top portable chargers for travel now for the full list that runs the gamut of price points head on over to ign.com and if you have any you're currently using please

> Black Myth: Wukong - Hands-On With an Impressive First 2 Hours
[Music] the list of impressive looking Souls like games on the horizon is long with games like Phantom Blade zero flint lock the siege of Dawn and Wu Chong Fallen feathers all having solid showings this Summer Event season but there's always been something extra special about black myth Wukong it's stunningly gorgeous the animations are incredibly fluid it's steeped in Rich Chinese culture and there's just something immensely satisfying about playing as a Monkey King beating up all sorts of mythical creatures with a giant extendable staff while this isn't the first time IGN has gone Hands-On with the game it is my own personal first time with it and after 2 hours of playtime with the opening chapter I somehow walked away even more excited for its August 20th [Music] release IGN China has already done an extensive preview on what Wukong plays like on a late game build with many techniques stances and Transformations already unlocked which is great because my two hours covered pretty much the very start of the game the first thing that I noticed as I started playing was how fluid and fast Wukong feels to control many Souls lights are built on a foundation of slower and more methodical combat but Wukong feels exceptionally quick and agile from the beginning there's actually no block button Wukong can twirl a staff to block projectiles but as far as melee attacks go everything must be dodged to that end there's a Bayonetta style Dodge system where you can dodge up to three times very quickly but after the third one you're punished with a lengthy recovery time to try and curb people from just mindlessly mashing the Dodge button perfectly timed Dodges will reward you with extra focus and once your focus bar has been filled you get a focus point that allows you to chain a strong attack into your light combo string for a big chunk of damage later on those Focus points can also be spent on different types of special moves that you unlock in the skill tree which we'll get to a bit later Wukong also has access to a number of spells that consume his Mana I only really got to play around with the immobilized spell which as you can imagine stops an enemy in their tracks and allows you to sneak in a few hits before the Spells effect wears off stronger enemies and especially bosses are affected by the spell much less and sometimes they were able to shrug it off entirely even at just an early stage combat was a fun dance of actively looking for opportunities to avoid enemy attacks and find openings keeping an eye on my focus meter so that I can use a damaging heavy attack whenever I had the chance while also managing my mana and cool down for my immobilize spell eventually I got my first transformation which turns Wukong into an absolute Beast with much stronger attacks and a hugely damaging Super Attack that he can use out of a Dodge if he manages to build up a focus point one of his moves in this transformation is a lightning fast Dash attack that made me feel like I had basically turned into the boss that I got the transformation from later on I added another tool to my repertoire the tower stance which swapped out my my chargeable overhead strong attack for the ability to stand on my staff and avoid damage on the ground as long as my stamina held out if I managed to stay on the staff long enough for a focus point to charge I could spend it to leap off the staff flip it around and come crashing down with the powerful strike that felt incredibly cool to pull off these stances along with my general combat abilities could all be upgraded through a level up system that works a lot like seyos as you defeat enemies you'll gain will which builds up a bar in the top right of the screen when the bar is full you gain a spark which can be used to purchase upgrades from one of your various skill trees once you fill a bar and Bank a point you can't lose it you can even add that point wherever you want not just at a shrine which serves as wukong's version of a bonfire like checkpoint however if you die before you manage to fill the bar a portion of that experience will be lost in typical souls-like fashion don't let that trick you into thinking that Wukong is an easy game though because it certainly is not enemies are aggressive bosses are Relentless and even more so in their second phases and you only have a scant few restorative potions to keep yourself alive I also managed to find a secret boss room behind a waterfall that took me to a dragon boss set absolutely wrecked me fortunately you can teleport from Shrine to Shrine so you can come back to him much later down the road once you've upgraded your gear and add some more points into your skill trees and speaking of gear I didn't manage to find all that much but I did find enough to at least know that there are sets of armor that Grant extra bonuses for wearing multiple pieces of gear from that set the levels themselves were fairly linear with a couple of branching points that led to some sort of treasure or item pickup the real star of the show though were the boss battles even in Just 2 hours I fought against a wide variety of bosses from a speedy wolf boss that I snagged my first transformation from to a mule kicking frog in human clothes to an extremely difficult two-phase battle against a snake man all in all I greatly enjoyed my time with black myth Wukong even in Just 2 hours of play time I felt like I got to experience a lot of combat progression and am excited to see how things will continue to evolve as as the game goes on we won't have to wait much longer to see how the full game shakes out as black myth Wukong releases on PC and PlayStation 5 on August 20th [Music]
